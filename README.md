# Mixed Messages

## Introduction

A terminal application which outputs a new, random every time it is executed.

Mixed Messages is a Codecademy student project in the Back-End Engineer Path, as well as other paths, to demonstrate basic Javascript and programming concepts.

While generally intended to be an introduction to programming in a team, no other students at a similar point in their path were available and so the project will be completed solo.

## Usage

mixed-messages is a command line program which requires Node.js. No additional setup is required. 

```
$ node mixed-messages.js
```

## Technologies

Project is created using:

- Node.js v16.13.1

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by MadLibs, which brought me great amusment as a child. I wonder if they're still around...
